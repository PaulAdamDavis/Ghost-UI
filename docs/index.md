### Notes & Naming Convention

* Classes for parent elements in Ghost-UI are prefixed with `gh-`, but child elements of an element with a `gh-` prefixes class usually don;t have the prefix.
* Never use ID's, even for JS selectors. Instead, for JS selectors, use a suitable class beginning with `js-`. This must have absolutely no styling applied to the class.
